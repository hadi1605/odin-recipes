        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Kibbeh, a form of the Arabic word kubbah or "ball," is a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine. Made out of lamb or beef, these football-shaped croquettes are a flavorful blend of fragrant herbs and spices, filling meat, and hearty bulgur wheat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound bulgur</li>
            <li>3 cups cold water</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, 1 finely chopped, 1 coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef or lamb, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper, divided</li>
            <li>And more</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, place the bulgur wheat and add the cold water. Let it soak for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove excess water by placing the bulgur in a cheesecloth or clean kitchen towel and thoroughly squeezing. Reserve.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the coarsely chopped onion with 1 pound of the meat, the soaked bulgur, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1 teaspoon of the pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Process the mixture in batches in a food processor: Pulse, then process to a sticky, smooth, dough-like consistency, adding some ice as needed to help break down the meat. Repeat the procedure until all of the beef mixture has been processed. Reserve, covered.</li>
            <li>In a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and the finely chopped onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining pound of meat and the pine nuts, if using. Break apart the meat with a wooden spoon until well combined. Add the allspice, remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and the cumin and stir well.</li>
            <li>And more</li>
        </ol>
